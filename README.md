# pyTestDocu
python framework for generation of test documents

Idea:
The script allowes you to generate dest documents which fulfill the requirements from 
IEEE 829 Standard for Software Test Documentation

I plane the usage of "pyTestDocu" for automated "system tests". The tests covers test of software and hardware components which are based on embedded linux boards.
used tools and technics: 
 - jenkins - build server
 - yocto   - build whole linux distribution 
 - lava    - test lab
 - github  - central repository for yocto layer, test scripts and test documentation
